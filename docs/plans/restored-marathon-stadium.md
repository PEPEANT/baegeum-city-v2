# Singularity Race / Restored Marathon Stadium Plan

Conclusion: `특이점레이스` now has a standalone local lobby entry at `singularity-race.html`, while the marathon stadium race itself remains a local 2D preview with online-facing packets shaped for future server-authoritative rooms, checkpoints, finishes, and rankings.

## Feature Identity

- Feature id: `restored:minigame:marathon-stadium`
- Public title: `특이점레이스` / Singularity Race
- Internal title: Restored Marathon Stadium
- Domain: minigame / online-ready race
- Primary surface: standalone lobby page `singularity-race.html`
- Secondary surface: Baegeum city place local practice panel
- Related docs:
  - `docs/baegeum-city-v2-restored-ui-online-ranking-chat-roadmap.md`
  - `docs/baegeum-city-v2-online-state-protocol.md`
  - `docs/baegeum-city-v2-online-lobby-contract.md`
  - `docs/baegeum-city-v2-operations-data-rules.md`

## Current Baseline

- Current playable behavior: the Baegeum city place opens a local 2D marathon preview, and `singularity-race.html` opens the public Singularity Race lobby preview.
- Current files or catalogs involved: restored game contracts live under `src/restored/games/`.
- Existing blockers: real online backend is unavailable. The current connected path is an explicit dev-only adapter opened by `?devOnline=1`, not public matchmaking.

## Intended Player Loop

```text
enter stadium
-> choose local practice or connected online room
-> countdown
-> move with WASD, sprint with Shift, spend stamina carefully
-> use E skills or mouse attacks only when the stop/stall risk is worth it
-> pass N checkpoints in order and receive server-seeded meme-style character assignments
-> if downed, respawn at the last safe checkpoint
-> finish
-> show local result or server-finalized online result
```

## Action Race Rules

- Movement: `WASD` moves freely inside the broad road surface: `A/D` moves backward/forward along trail progress, `W/S` changes the lateral road position, `Shift` sprints, and idle/recover frames restore stamina.
- Skill: `E` requests the currently assigned character skill. Rare, chaos, and legend skills can be one-use.
- Mouse attack: mouse-directed attacks can slow, shove, or down another runner, but the attacker stalls long enough that running is usually the better race strategy.
- Soft pass pressure: local preview runners share one broad trail surface, but nearby runners no longer act like hard walls or ghosts. When bodies overlap in progress and lane position, each runner gets a brief speed drag, collision glow, small lane separation, and tiny forward/back separation so the pack feels like soft body contact. Real online collision, body pressure, and position reconciliation must be server-owned.
- Chat focus: `T` focuses the current lobby or room chat input, then `Enter` submits through the current channel transport.
- Checkpoints: the course can have any N-stage checkpoint plan. Each checkpoint may assign a new server-seeded character from the meme-style original catalog.
- Down state: attack damage or strong skill effects can down a runner; the runner respawns at the last safe checkpoint instead of being eliminated.
- Balance target: attacks are for mid-pack chaos and clutch defense, not the main way to win. The fastest line should usually be clean movement, sprint timing, and checkpoint routing.

The contract owns both the local race math and the online-ready message vocabulary so the feature does not scatter small protocol files.

The action-race layer uses WASD movement, Shift sprint, E skill use, and mouse-directed attack. `src/restored/games/marathon-input-contract.js` normalizes those inputs into server-checkable frames. Mouse attacks intentionally lock or stall movement, so running remains the best default strategy.

`src/restored/games/marathon-character-skill-contract.js` owns checkpoint character assignment and skill metadata. Each checkpoint can grant a deterministic server-seeded meme-style original runner such as `도로롱 주자`, `분노의 댓글러`, `추천요정`, or `새벽반 고인물`. These are parody/original labels, not a hard dependency on external character IP. Common characters have modest movement or disruption tools; rare and legend characters can have one-use skills.

`src/restored/games/marathon-combat-contract.js` owns mouse attack hit tests, attacker stall, slow/knockback results, runner-down state, and checkpoint respawn envelopes. If a runner is downed, they return to the last safe checkpoint rather than being eliminated.

`src/restored/games/marathon-trail-geometry.js` owns the public course shape: one shared 2D log-curve trail, five save points, SVG path generation, pointer-to-progress estimation, and the matching marathon-distance checkpoint meters. The standalone lobby renders that trail directly so 30 runners preview the same route instead of separate horizontal lanes.

The restored HTML now mounts the local preview view from the Baegeum street surface through `marathon_stadium`; this is a local practice panel, not an online lobby.

The local preview advances in one-minute strategic ticks, shows the next checkpoint split, and renders a read-only online packet rail (`join_request`, `input_update`, `state_snapshot`, and checkpoint or finalization packet) so later server work has visible protocol anchors without exposing a fake lobby.

The standalone `특이점레이스` lobby opens local-only by default. The player-facing flow is now intentionally simple: first online entry shows nickname plus skin selection, then a single room-list lobby with no visible chat, runner count, ready count, quick-entry control, notice box, or protocol/debug rows, then a `대기열` view with only runner slots, a `맵 미리보기` button, and chat, then a separate map preview screen, then the race screen only after admin/direct race entry. The queue view intentionally hides top metrics, ready counters, ready buttons, duplicate room cards, channel tabs, badges, and explanatory copy so phone portrait and landscape stay readable. The map preview is a whole-course schematic, not the player-follow camera: it hides runner/HUD overlays and fits the full trail, save points, and finish section into the preview panel. The old room/ready state name is no longer used in the player flow; the normal states are `profile -> lobby -> queue -> mapPreview -> race`. The standalone page is now a thinner controller: `singularity-race-flow.js` owns screen ids and short flow copy, `singularity-race-queue.js` owns queue slots and chat rows, `singularity-race-track.js` owns repeated track-effect DOM helpers, `singularity-race-local-sim.js` owns start paddock and local bot movement, `singularity-race-dev-online.js` owns the dev room relay wrappers plus server snapshot-to-runner display merging, and `singularity-race-control.js` owns the dev-only start-countdown command shape, storage key, broadcast name, and phase label. `singularity-race-runner-view.js` remains the shared runner DOM helper. Connected `state_snapshot` packets now feed those display layers without adding more inline HTML script. Once the player is in the race screen, lobby sidebars, waiting-room controls, chat panel, top lobby status bar, track header, action HUD, checkpoint strip, standings, packet rails, progress pill, map caption, and start-gate text are hidden so the race screen is just the in-game stadium surface until the next UI redesign. Race screens keep the three bottom controls over that clean stadium baseline: `대기열 보기/닫기`, `채팅창 열기/닫기`, and `플레이 시작` with `관리자 대기중` until the host countdown starts. A separate PC-and-mobile input layer now provides a left circular WASD pad plus right-side `스킬(E)` and `채팅(T)` buttons; opening queue or chat hides the movement controls so overlays do not fight with gameplay input. The normal race skin picker now uses `src/skins/singularity-race-skin-presets.js`, a small original meme-style runner pack, instead of exposing casino/general-citizen or old robot/anime presets.

The connected room gate only opens with the dev query `?devOnline=1`, then requires `join_result ok` from `src/restored/online/marathon-room-adapter.js` before a connected room is shown. Player-facing UI no longer exposes `join_request`, `state_snapshot`, netcode budget rows, relay packet counts, raw room ids, or `SERVER LOCKED` status unless the page is opened with `?debug=1`. Room waiting chat still has visible room, lobby, and spectator channel tabs backed by the dev channel adapter, while system/dev messages are hidden from the normal chat surface.

The standalone lobby also has a first local action preview wired to those contracts: keyboard frames can move the local runner, `E` can consume or request the assigned skill, and mouse clicks on the track run the attack contract. The preview now renders an action HUD with current character, skill charge state, HP, cleared checkpoints, and a server-shaped action packet rail for `skill_use`, `attack_action`, `checkpoint_reward`, and `respawn_notice`. This is only a local feel test; connected mode still treats movement, skill use, attack hits, checkpoint rewards, respawns, and race finalization as server-authoritative.

The single-trail lobby now also renders local-only race feedback on top of the SVG trail: a player focus ring, a progress and next-save pill, and short visual cues for checkpoint, skill, hit, respawn, and local finish-preview moments. The local race progress clamp reaches the real 100% finish instead of stopping short, and `LOCAL_FINISH_PROGRESS` only creates a local server-owned `race_finalized` rehearsal packet plus ranking preview. These cues are cosmetic and must not become the source of online checkpoint, hit, respawn, finish, ranking, or reward authority.

The local lobby now starts with a 30-runner practice pack inside a broad start paddock behind a closed start gate. Runners are no longer forced into a straight line; each runner owns trail `progress` plus a `laneOffsetPx` inside the road width. Before the race starts, players can move freely inside the staging area but cannot pass the gate. The admin page sends a dev-only `start_countdown` control signal, the lobby shows a 10-second countdown, and the gate opens on `GO`. This still does not send per-frame positions or pretend to be public multiplayer.

The standalone lobby track now renders inside a larger camera-followed world instead of fitting the full route into the viewport. The player stays centered while the log-curve trail scrolls underneath, SVG stroke widths are locked with non-scaling strokes so the rail width stays consistent from the horizontal start to the vertical finish, and runner sprites are transparent image layers rather than dark framed cards. The track world is now deliberately long and wide (`7600x2600` preview pixels), with a wider start-view layout and extra-thick rail strokes so the marathon reads like a huge course instead of a compressed minimap. The current visual style borrows the Drawing World paper/grid feeling: light paper panels, simple room cards, compact chat, a pale stadium field, and a muted green-gray rail instead of a black curb that fights the road surface. The local starting pack keeps all 30 runners in the same gated start area, scatters them across the road width, lets them shift positions before release, then starts each runner from their current local position when the admin countdown opens the gate. The usable lane clamp now reaches close to the visible road walls instead of leaving a transparent inner buffer, while still keeping runner centers inside the road. Runner names are attached inside the same avatar node and pinned under the feet so sprint/interpolation cannot leave names behind; the head area stays reserved for future health bars and status effects. The local preview pacing is now tuned for feel first: staging movement is quick enough to claim a start spot, `Shift` makes forward running visibly faster, and `W/S` lane movement is slower so it does not read like the real speed button. The final public race duration still belongs to server-owned balance values after connected movement exists. The skin picker now highlights requested race favorites first: `kaguya`, `singularity-fan`, `robot`, `gpichan`, `pepe-runner`, `moderator-armband`, `yalrkun`, `lakers-wile`, `sam-altman`, and `demis-hassabis`.

`singularity-race-admin.html?devOnline=1` is the separate dev-only future host page. The lobby includes a visible admin-page link so the page can be checked in-game during development. The page now presents Korean host/spectator controls instead of raw packet metrics: room list, `게임 바로 보기`, lobby link, whole-course camera, runner watch list, channel tabs, and `10초 카운트다운 시작`. Without the dev gate, the page stays an operating shell and must not expose real authority.

The host page still reads the dev room packet relay internally, but it no longer makes room packet counts, channel counts, stored-message counts, or connection-gate labels part of the visible UI. Its dev-only countdown control writes a separated local race-control signal through `src/restored/games/singularity-race-control.js` so the game page can rehearse admin-started gate release without making local race results authoritative. Real public online must move this to server-authenticated host authority and server-owned room start time.

`src/restored/online/marathon-dev-chat-transport.js` is the temporary connected-room chat transport boundary. It persists the latest 500 dev chat records to the local dev chat log so lobby, queue, race, and admin page refreshes do not wipe chat history during testing. Lobby and admin pages now talk to this adapter instead of reading and writing chat storage directly. The adapter also uses a same-origin broadcast relay when available, so separate lobby/admin tabs refresh channel messages without coupling their UI code. Real public online must replace this local log with server-owned room chat history, pagination, moderation state, and reconnect replay.

`src/restored/online/marathon-dev-room-transport.js` is the temporary dev-only room packet relay. After `?devOnline=1` and `join_result ok`, the lobby writes validated server-shaped join, input, skill, attack, and snapshot envelopes into a room-scoped local packet log and broadcasts updates to same-origin dev clients. It is a delivery rehearsal, not a public backend, and cannot make local attack/checkpoint/finalization decisions authoritative.

`src/restored/online/marathon-netcode-contract.js` owns the 30-runner latency and bandwidth budget before a real server exists. The baseline is 20 Hz input requests, 10 Hz server snapshots, compact runner deltas, client-side interpolation, and adaptive lanes (`smooth`, `buffered`, `degraded`, `critical`) that reduce send/snapshot cadence when ping, jitter, or packet loss is bad. It also owns the dev relay packet pressure report, rate-limit decision, visual anti-teleport policy, ping sample math, and reconciliation hints. Remote and bot runner display positions should move through `resolveRestoredMarathonVisualStep()` instead of drawing every server/bot correction immediately; only very large corrections are allowed to snap. The lobby renders this budget so optimization stays visible while testing. `tools/smoke-singularity-race-progression.cjs` is the repeatable local gate for start-to-finish reachability, Shift+D sprint input, 30-runner bandwidth, degraded-lane behavior, packet spam rejection, anti-teleport smoothing, and bot movement when the player is stopped.

`src/restored/online/marathon-server-transport-contract.js` is the first server-shaped transport contract boundary. It does not open a real socket yet. It fixes the unavailable default, WebSocket/Firebase-style provider config without embedded secrets, connected transport snapshot, and the packet envelope shape for `hello`, `join_request`, `join_result`, `chat_send`, `chat_delivered`, `input_update`, `skill_use`, `attack_action`, `checkpoint_reward`, `respawn_notice`, `state_snapshot`, `race_finalized`, and disconnect notices. `input_update` packets now preserve normalized direction and input mode so the server can distinguish forward marathon movement from lateral-only movement. `src/restored/online/marathon-server-room-adapter.js` can now build a `server_transport` room adapter only when a connected server transport snapshot and server-provided room list are injected.

`src/restored/online/marathon-server-state-contract.js` is the first server-owned movement boundary. It starts a server room, converts accepted `input_update` envelopes into server input commands, rejects stale input sequences, advances only server room participants, keeps side-only input from increasing race progress, stamps finish time, and emits server-owned runner snapshot rows. The player page now consumes compatible `state_snapshot` rows through `mergeSingularityServerSnapshotRunners()`, preserving local display skin/name data while replacing progress, lane, sequence metadata, and race phase from the server payload. This is still a contract/mock layer, but it proves the public server shape before any real socket or Firebase provider is connected.

`src/restored/online/marathon-websocket-dev-server-mock.js` is the local WebSocket-shaped server rehearsal. It does not open a public port or require a WebSocket package. It consumes the server transport and server-state contracts, creates a connected `websocket` transport snapshot, exposes a server-backed room adapter, accepts only client-owned packets (`chat_send`, `input_update`, `skill_use`, `attack_action`), rejects server-owned finalization/snapshot/reward packets from clients, applies the netcode packet-pressure guard, applies accepted input to server-owned runner state during `racing`, and emits server-created `join_result`, `chat_delivered`, and `state_snapshot` envelopes. Dev `state_snapshot` payloads are now explicitly `serverOwned`, carry `movementAuthority: "server"`, snapshot id, server tick/snapshot cadence, ping sample, and reconciliation metadata so the next real transport can replace the mock without trusting local positions.

## UI Surface Plan

- Top bar impact: standalone lobby shows only the public game title above the room list. Runner count, readiness count, room chat, and connection/debug status do not appear until the player enters the room or opens `?debug=1`.
- Player flow impact: the normal standalone page should move through `profile -> lobby -> queue -> mapPreview -> race`; debug and protocol details belong behind `?debug=1`. The `대기열` screen should stay at runner slots, `맵 미리보기`, and chat only, and `맵 미리보기` must return to the queue instead of starting the race.
- Bottom nav impact: no permanent marathon tab. The stadium should be a city/place entry.
- Phone app impact: online rooms and season rankings belong behind a connected phone online lobby or rankings app.
- Modal or panel impact: first local panel should show course, standings, pace buttons, stamina, checkpoints, and finish result.
- Mobile constraints: pace controls should be four compact buttons: recover, steady, push, sprint.
- Illustration or image slot: lobby skin thumbnails use the Singularity Race SVG preset adapter; stadium background and runner sprites can use manifest ids later; no direct asset paths in the contract.

## State And Catalog Plan

- New state fields: local race state may be mounted under a future `marathon` slice, but online results must not trust local save state.
- Static catalog entries: future stadium place id should be `baegeum:marathon-stadium`.
- Migration or save compatibility: no save migration in the contract slice.
- Selectors needed: local best time, latest rank, checkpoint progress.
- Events produced: race result, ranking snapshot candidate, online authority request, UI message.

## Online Authority

Online marathon uses room authority from the start:

```text
lobby -> countdown -> racing -> finished
```

Required packets:

- `join_request`
- `join_result`
- `input_update`
- `skill_use`
- `attack_action`
- `checkpoint_reward`
- `respawn_notice`
- `checkpoint_claim`
- `finish_claim`
- `state_snapshot`
- `race_finalized`

Server-owned decisions:

- room membership
- start time
- checkpoint order
- finish time
- final rank
- checkpoint character assignment seed
- skill charge validation
- attack hit validation
- checkpoint respawn position
- single-rail collision order and no-pass resolution
- online leaderboard snapshot
- reconnect grace and expiration
- netcode lane selection for real connected rooms when client metrics are untrusted

Client-owned local preview:

- bot simulation
- camera and runner interpolation
- local practice result
- visual effects
- interpolation display and cosmetic reduction while the server stays authoritative

Do not show a fake offline online lobby. Offline local practice is a different button and must not look like a connected room list.

Current dev-only adapter rules:

- Default adapter is unavailable and exposes no room list.
- `?devOnline=1` creates a deterministic dev room using adapter type `dev_mock`.
- The connected lobby gate opens only when the online adapter reports `connected` and `lobbyEnabled`.
- Normal player UI must keep the dev connected gate, packet log, netcode budget, relay guard, raw ids, and server authority labels hidden unless `?debug=1` is present.
- Room join is blocked on map, venue schema, or protocol mismatch.
- Successful dev join emits `join_request`, `join_result`, and `state_snapshot` packets.
- Dev chat channels are pre-created as `lobby`, `room`, `spectator`, `admin`, and `system`; players cannot see or send to the admin channel.
- The lobby and admin pages share the same local dev chat log through `singularity-race:chat:v1` via the dev chat transport until real server chat delivery exists.
- The dev chat log keeps the latest 500 messages locally across refresh/re-entry. This is for development continuity only; public chat history must be server-owned, channel-scoped, paginated, and moderation-aware.
- The dev room packet relay stores room packets under a room-scoped local key and relays same-origin updates after `join_result ok`; it is still gated by `?devOnline=1`.
- The dev host/admin page can observe that room-scoped packet relay internally, but the visible page should stay a Korean room/camera/player-watch surface until real server-authenticated host authority exists.
- The dev host/admin page can send the local `start_countdown` gate-control rehearsal. Real public online must move this to a server-owned room start time and authenticated admin or host command.
- The visible host page should not expose raw packet counts, channel counts, stored-message counts, or connection-gate labels as the primary operator UI.
- The 30-runner netcode budget keeps default upstream near 8 kbps per player and downstream under the documented player budget using input coalescing, server snapshots, and interpolation rather than per-frame position spam.
- The dev room packet relay uses the netcode packet pressure guard to block per-client action packet spam above the input budget while still allowing room setup and snapshot packets.
- The client display path has an anti-teleport layer: remote and bot target coordinates are smoothed toward their authoritative target with a max visual step, and only corrections beyond the snap cap are applied instantly. The local player remains responsive client-side while server reconciliation is added later.
- Dev connected snapshots are server-owned rehearsal packets: they include `snapshotId`, server tick/snapshot cadence, ping sample, and reconciliation metadata. These values are for testing the correction path only; real public rooms must compute them on the backend from server time and authoritative runner state.
- The dev WebSocket-shaped mock now applies accepted `input_update` packets to server-owned room participants and snapshots the resulting progress. Client-side local progress remains display-only and cannot finalize public results.
- The server transport contract is unavailable by default and only validates server-shaped config, snapshots, and envelopes; it does not create a fake online backend.
- The server transport adapter can represent future WebSocket or Firebase providers, but it opens the connected lobby only when a connected transport snapshot and server room list are injected. No Firebase app config, API key, token, or secret belongs in this client contract.
- The local WebSocket dev server mock is a contract test harness only. It can prove handshake, room list, join, server-owned start, packet ingest, server movement, snapshot creation, finish clamp, and rate limiting without binding a network port or exposing public matchmaking.
- The dev adapter marks rooms as `SERVER_REQUIRED`; local completion or ranking still cannot become authoritative.

## Real Online Readiness

Current problems to solve before public online:

- The player page can apply server-owned `state_snapshot` rows, but the visible connected path still needs a real periodic transport loop that sends snapshots every server tick/snapshot interval.
- Chat history is only a local dev log. Public rooms need server-owned message persistence, recent-history replay, pagination, moderation status, mute/ban handling, and room/channel retention rules.
- Single-rail collision, attack hits, checkpoint rewards, respawns, finish order, and ranking are still local preview or mock-contract rehearsals. Public play must move all of those decisions to the server.
- The 30-runner bandwidth budget is documented and smoke-tested, but real rooms still need load tests for bursty input, chat spam, disconnect/reconnect, tab throttling, and slow phones.
- The current player camera follows position only. It does not yet rotate with the road tangent through the curve, so the vertical finish segment can feel like the runner is moving upward on the page instead of following the road.

Implementation path for the real online bridge:

1. Add a deterministic in-page dev snapshot loop that consumes the WebSocket-shaped dev server mock and emits periodic server-created `state_snapshot` packets.
2. Replace the local dev room relay with a real WebSocket or Firebase transport adapter behind the existing server transport contract.
3. Keep clients input-only: send `input_update`, `skill_use`, `attack_action`, and `chat_send`; never send authoritative position, reward, respawn, finish, ranking, or snapshot packets from clients.
4. Add server chat history replay: join returns recent channel messages, and scrolling can request older pages.
5. Add reconnect grace: a reconnecting player receives the latest server room state, recent chat, and their authoritative runner snapshot.
6. Run 30-runner soak tests for at least one full race duration with packet pressure, ping, and visual correction metrics visible to the host page.

Camera direction plan:

- Keep the UI, buttons, chat, queue overlay, and HUD unrotated.
- Rotate only the track world, and only after the curve begins. The straight start should stay stable.
- Use `progressToRestoredMarathonTrailPoint(progress).tangent` as the target road direction.
- Smooth the camera angle over time and clamp per-frame angular change so it feels like the road turns under the player, not like the screen snaps.
- Default mode should be `soft-follow`: no rotation on the start straight, partial road-follow rotation through the curve, and a gentle final alignment near the finish.
- Add an accessibility/debug option for `fixed`, `soft-follow`, and `road-follow` before making rotation permanent.
- Pointer-to-track math, attack targeting, and mobile virtual controls must be verified after rotation because world coordinates and screen coordinates will no longer line up without an inverse camera transform.

## Ranking Impact

- Local rank impact: local practice can show latest place and best time.
- Online leaderboard impact: server snapshots can later expose `marathonBestTime`, `marathonWins`, and `marathonSeasonPoints`.
- Job or occupation ranking impact: none in the first slice.
- Board ids: `marathonBestTime`, `marathonWins`, `marathonSeasonPoints`.
- Snapshot shape changes: reuse the phone ranking snapshot pattern with server-owned entries.
- Server authority needed: all online boards.

## Economy And Rewards

- Cash/chips/items affected: none in the first contract slice.
- Ledger or event boundary: future prizes must emit an effect envelope; client finish does not pay rewards directly.
- Inventory or asset ownership rules: future medals or shoes must use inventory/asset contracts.
- Risks: reward farming if local race results are trusted online.

## Relationship, Chat, And Spectators

- Partner state affected: none in the first slice.
- Memory events: future date or cheering events should consume race result events, not mutate partners directly.
- Public channel impact: future room chat should be `venue:baegeum-marathon-stadium` or a room-scoped channel.
- Spectators: allowed online participant type, but spectators do not consume the 30 runner slots.
- Admin channel: dev-only admin chat exists for operator testing and must become server-authenticated before public use.

## Implementation Order

1. Add this plan and the pure marathon contract.
2. Guard the contract through one smoke check and the existing game-contract purity gate.
3. Add a local 2D stadium surface using the contract.
4. Add bot runner generation for 29 local preview runners.
5. Add standalone local Singularity Race lobby entry.
6. Add dev-only connected marathon room adapter and connected-only lobby gate.
7. Add dev room packet relay for join, input, skill, attack, and snapshot envelopes.
8. Add WASD/Shift/E/mouse input, checkpoint character reward, skills, attack, and respawn contracts.
9. Add local action-race preview controls without changing the connected online authority.
10. Add a local WebSocket-shaped dev server mock that consumes the server transport contract without opening public online.
11. Add server-owned snapshot, ping sample, reconciliation, and movement-state rehearsal data behind the dev transport boundary before any public provider is enabled.
12. Add a real server transport adapter for join, input, snapshot, and finalization behind a connected WebSocket/Firebase provider.
13. Add phone rankings only after server-owned snapshots exist.

## Verification Plan

- Narrow check: `node tools/check-restored-marathon-contract.cjs`
- Server-state smoke: `node tools/smoke-singularity-race-server-state.cjs`
- Full check: `npm run check`
- Browser check: after UI wiring, run `npm start` and verify `http://127.0.0.1:4173/singularity-race.html`, `http://127.0.0.1:4173/singularity-race.html?devOnline=1`, `http://127.0.0.1:4173/singularity-race-admin.html?devOnline=1`, plus the Baegeum city stadium page when touched.
- Manual play notes: confirm 30 runners, WASD/Shift/E/mouse intent, checkpoint character assignment, attack stall, checkpoint respawn, finish ranking, and no online lobby while unavailable.

## Do Not

- Do not split the first contract across many small protocol files.
- Do not add a fake offline online lobby.
- Do not send the player to `baegeum-city-v2-dice.html` when they ask for the public `특이점레이스` lobby.
- Do not expose the dev connected adapter without the explicit `?devOnline=1` gate.
- Do not expose admin channel controls without server-authenticated admin authority in real online mode.
- Do not make online finish time or ranking client-authoritative.
- Do not make checkpoint random character assignment, rare skill charge use, attack hit results, or respawn positions client-authoritative.
- Do not pay rewards from local preview results.
- Do not put marathon into permanent bottom navigation.
