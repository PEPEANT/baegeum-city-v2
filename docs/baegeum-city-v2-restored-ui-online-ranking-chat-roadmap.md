# Baegeum City V2 Restored UI, Online, Ranking, And Chat Roadmap

Conclusion: the restored build should improve its UI first by naming stable surfaces, then grow online, ranking, and chat through contracts instead of adding more loose handlers to `baegeum-city-v2-dice.html`.

## Purpose

This document owns the next planning layer for the active restored build:

```text
index.html -> baegeum-city-v2-dice.html
```

Use it before broad UI redesign, online lobby work, ranking screens, partner chat expansion, or public chat work.

- `docs/baegeum-city-v2-restored-growth-architecture.md`

## Current Restored Baseline

Current runtime navigation is location-aware instead of feature-tab-driven:

```text
home_inside
  -> myinfo / home / go_out

home_front
  -> fast_food / labor_office / convenience_store / bus_stop / go_home

city_district
  -> places for the current city
```

News, stocks, futures, rankings, chat, and the relationship/lover list belong inside a phone/app surface, not the global bottom nav or the My Info panel. If the player has no phone, those apps should not be reachable. If the player has a folder phone, basic news, stock access, and a simple relationship app can unlock. Smartphone-only apps such as futures, advanced charts, AI calls, and richer chat can unlock later.

Current split status:

- `src/restored/state/initial-state.js` owns initial state.
- `src/restored/state/storage.js` owns save/load and cash-only restore helpers.
- `src/restored/state/selectors.js` owns total asset, rank, phone ownership, smartphone ownership, and carried inventory calculations.
- `src/restored/account/session-contract.js` owns the restored login/account and online availability state shape.
- `src/restored/online/online-adapter-contract.js` owns the restored online adapter snapshot, unavailable default, and lobby availability guard.
- `src/restored/online/marathon-room-adapter.js` owns the dev-only Singularity Race connected room adapter, while `src/restored/online/marathon-server-room-adapter.js` owns the server-transport-backed adapter shape; it stays unavailable by default, opens through an explicit dev gate for local rehearsal, or opens only when a connected server transport snapshot and server room list are injected.
- `src/restored/online/marathon-channel-adapter.js` owns the dev-only Singularity Race lobby, room, spectator, admin, and notice channel set plus local message shape.
- `src/restored/online/marathon-dev-chat-transport.js` owns the temporary same-origin dev chat relay so lobby/admin screens no longer read or write the marathon chat log directly.
- `src/restored/online/marathon-dev-room-transport.js` owns the temporary same-origin dev room packet relay for Singularity Race join/input/skill/attack/snapshot envelopes.
- `src/restored/online/marathon-netcode-contract.js` owns the 30-runner Singularity Race latency/bandwidth budget, input coalescing, server snapshot cadence, interpolation buffer, degraded network lanes, and dev relay packet pressure guard.
- `src/restored/online/marathon-server-transport-contract.js` owns the first server-shaped Singularity Race transport config/snapshot/envelope boundary for future WebSocket or Firebase join, chat, input, snapshot, finalization, and disconnect delivery. It rejects embedded secret-like config keys and does not open a socket by itself.
- `src/restored/online/marathon-websocket-dev-server-mock.js` owns the local WebSocket-shaped server rehearsal: connected transport snapshot, room list, join result, client-packet ingest, server-owned snapshot creation, and netcode rate limiting without opening a public port.
- `src/restored/games/marathon-input-contract.js`, `marathon-character-skill-contract.js`, and `marathon-combat-contract.js` own the first Singularity Race action layer: WASD movement, Shift sprint, E skills, mouse attack stall, checkpoint meme-style character rewards, and checkpoint respawn.
- `src/restored/player/profile-contract.js` owns the player profile, job title, residence label, condition label, and core stats that the My Info surface renders.
- `src/restored/phone/phone-app-contract.js` owns phone app ids, labels, icons, and phone/smartphone gates before chat, ranking, or online lobby apps are added.
- `src/restored/phone/phone-app-ecosystem-contract.js` owns the planned phone OS/app-store catalog, including BaeTalk-style messenger, relationships, Baegeum Gallery-style community, rankings, bank/pay, map, and online lobby candidates.
- The partner/lover list is a phone app entry. My Info only shows a compact relationship summary.
- `src/restored/inventory/consumable-contract.js` owns registered consumable use effects, starting with energy drink energy recovery.
- `src/restored/inventory/inventory-view.js` owns the My Info carried-item preview rendering.
- Static catalogs for ranks, markets, assets, partners, the first three city ids, and the first location contexts now live under `src/restored/data/`.
- `src/restored/ui/location-nav-contract.js` owns the home, house-front, travel, and city action sets consumed by the playable shell.

## Login Home Transition

The restored build has moved from a visible save-code start screen to a local login home.

Rules:

- The normal player UI should not show the legacy save-code backup center.
- Guest/local login is enough for offline play.
- Online login must stay disabled or unavailable until a real online adapter can report a connected state.
- MammonCity2 is the reference for login shell, online shape, and phone UI, but Firebase config and anonymous-auth behavior should not be copied directly into restored runtime.
- Legacy save-code helpers may remain in `src/restored/state/storage.js` as hidden migration helpers until account-backed saves are stable.

The migration plan lives in `docs/plans/restored-login-home-online-phone-migration.md`.
The UI redesign preflight plan lives in `docs/plans/restored-ui-surface-redesign.md`.

## UI Surfaces

Future UI work should split by player location and job, not by old global tabs.

Primary surfaces:

- Top bar: player rank title, cash, total asset, current city, and future online status.
- Location-aware bottom nav: shows only actions/places valid for `home_inside`, `home_front`, the current city district, or travel.
- My info: character sheet for identity, relationship summary, job, residence, condition, core stats, and account status.
- Home shell: start location with `myinfo`, `home`, and `go_out`.
- Home-front shell: first outside location with fast food, labor office, convenience store, bus stop, and return-home actions.
- Phone shell: app grid, app stage/window, notifications, relationship/lover app, partner DM entry, news, stocks, futures, rankings, and future online services.
- App store: Baegeum Store, where planned phone apps appear before they become live registry entries.
- Relationship panel: phone-launched partner mood, stage, memory hints, call/message/gift/date choices.
- Dialogue modal: branching choices, emotional result preview, memory references, and illustration slot.
- Casino surface: bet controls, game table, settlement feed, and partner reaction strip.
- Shop and ownership: buy/sell, inventory, gift eligibility, and item story value.
- City/place surface: future city split, actor presence, travel, and place-specific actions.

The bottom nav must not become a permanent list of every feature. It should change from house, to house-front, to city, to travel context.

## Design Draft

The restored game should feel like a compact life-and-risk sim, not a landing page.

Design direction:

- Economy screens should be dense, scannable, and calm.
- Casino screens can carry stronger contrast, table color, chips, and result motion.
- Partner and conversation screens can be softer, image-led, and emotionally focused.
- Phone screens should look like a practical in-game phone UI, with app icons, unread marks, small status indicators, and in-phone app views instead of global pages.
- Illustration slots should be reserved early even before final art exists, using manifest ids and fallbacks.

First redesign pass:

```text
top bar
-> location-aware bottom nav
-> home_inside shell
-> home_front shell
-> phone shell
-> my info shell
-> relationship phone app
-> casino surface
-> shop/ownership cards
```

Do not redesign every visual at once. Lock the surface names in code first, then improve each view.

## Online Expansion

The restored build remains offline-first, but online-ready.

Authority Rules:

- Local offline state may calculate single-player cash, ownership, partner state, and casino outcomes.
- Online leaderboard rank must be server-authoritative.
- Online chat delivery, moderation, room membership, and history must be server-authoritative.
- Online casino settlement should not be added until ledger/action authority is explicit.
- No fake offline lobby. The online lobby only appears after a real connected or explicit dev-mock connected state.
- Version gates must follow `baegeum-city-v2-online-lobby-contract.md`.

Recommended online phases:

1. Add a read-only online status selector and UI slot in the top bar.
2. Add a restored online adapter contract that can return `unavailable` by default. Current status: implemented in `src/restored/online/online-adapter-contract.js`.
3. Add dev-only mock connection for tests, not for normal offline play. Current Singularity Race status: `?devOnline=1` opens the dev-only marathon room adapter and requires `join_result ok` before the connected room gate switches to `DEV ROOM`; `singularity-race-admin.html?devOnline=1` opens the separate admin view and admin-only channel, with chat routed through the dev chat transport.
4. Add phone-based online lobby entry after connected state.
5. Add presence and chat channel sync. Current Singularity Race prep: the server transport envelope and local WebSocket-shaped server mock exist, but no real WebSocket endpoint is configured.
6. Add read-only leaderboard snapshots.
7. Add server-authoritative economy and casino settlement only after ledger contracts are ready.

Minimum connection states:

```js
{
  status: "offline | unavailable | connecting | connected | disconnected_grace | expired",
  clientId: "",
  serverTimeMs: 0,
  lastError: ""
}
```

## Ranking System

Local rank and online ranking are different.

Local rank:

- Comes from current wealth/title selectors.
- Drives avatar, house flavor, and life-stage copy.
- Can stay fully offline.

Online ranking:

- Comes from server-authoritative snapshots.
- Should live in the phone as a `rankings` app.
- Should not overwrite local title/rank.

Suggested boards:

- `netWorth`: total wealth leaderboard.
- `cash`: liquid cash leaderboard.
- `casinoProfit`: season casino profit.
- `biggestWin`: biggest single casino win.
- `collector`: owned luxury/real-estate score.
- `jobRank`: job or occupation level leaderboard.
- `jobIncome`: income earned through jobs.
- `jobReputation`: job-specific reputation, reliability, or fame.
- `relationshipReputation`: future social/relationship reputation, not raw affection.

Job boards should not be raw wealth aliases. A player can be high wealth but low job reputation, or poor but high job rank in a specific occupation.

Suggested job ranking dimensions:

- current occupation title
- occupation level
- job income earned this season
- job streak or reliability
- job-specific reputation
- job badges or licenses

Minimum snapshot shape:

```js
{
  seasonId: "season:local-dev",
  boardId: "netWorth",
  scope: "local | global | friends | room",
  generatedAt: 0,
  entries: [
    {
      playerId: "local-player",
      displayName: "Player",
      score: 0,
      rank: 1,
      badge: "local-preview"
    }
  ]
}
```

First implementation should be a local preview selector plus a phone ranking screen. Online boards should be wired only after online snapshots exist.

Job or occupation ranking should start as a local preview board in the phone. Online job rankings should wait until occupation ids, season rules, and server-owned score snapshots exist.

## Chat Expansion

Chat starts in the phone and grows outward.

Offline chat:

- The partner/lover list is the relationship app home inside the phone.
- Partner DM is the first restored chat surface.
- Partner lines should come from a dialogue catalog, not hard-coded button strings.
- Relationship state should include affection, trust, tension, jealousy, comfort, and memory before deep branching.
- AI-generated text must not be a hard dependency. Catalog fallback is required.

Online chat:

- Use the channel model from `docs/baegeum-city-v2-chat.md`.
- Server owns delivery, history, moderation status, and channel membership.
- Client may render optimistic messages only with a `clientNonce`.
- Rate limits and block/report affordances should exist before public chat is exposed.

Channels to prepare:

- `partner_dm:<partner-id>`
- `world:baegeum-city`
- `world:dice-city`
- `venue:<venue-id>`
- `table:<venue-id>:main`
- `system:notice`

Minimum message shape:

```js
{
  id: "message-id",
  channelId: "partner_dm:college-student",
  senderId: "local-player",
  senderType: "player | partner | system | remote_player",
  text: "message",
  createdAt: 0,
  clientNonce: "",
  moderationStatus: "local | pending | approved | hidden"
}
```

## Expansion Order

1. Keep restored static catalogs for ranks, assets, markets, partner archetypes, and first city ids guarded.
2. Add UI surface contracts for top bar, bottom nav, phone shell, relationship panel, dialogue modal, casino surface, and ranking screen.
3. Move phone app rendering into `src/restored/phone/`. Current status: app ids and device gates live in `src/restored/phone/phone-app-contract.js`; planned app-store candidates live in `src/restored/phone/phone-app-ecosystem-contract.js`.
4. Add a relationship/lover phone app id and move the partner list entry point out of My Info.
5. Keep the runtime shell consuming the location navigation contract for `home_inside`, `home_front`, `baegeum-city`, `dice-city`, and `seosan-city`.
6. Add local ranking snapshot selectors and a phone ranking app.
7. Add relationship/emotion v2 state beside legacy `love`.
8. Add partner DM catalog and message history contract.
9. Add illustration catalog hooks for dialogue and partner mood.
10. Add online adapter and read-only top-bar status. Current status: adapter contract exists; top-bar status reads restored state.
11. Add online lobby entry only after connected/dev-mock connected state.
12. Add online chat delivery and leaderboard snapshots.

## Do Not

- Do not put news, stocks, futures, rankings, or chat into permanent global bottom navigation.
- Do not render the full partner/lover list in My Info; it belongs in the phone relationship app.
- Do not add every new place as a global tab; add it to the current location or city context.
- Do not build a fake offline lobby.
- Do not make online ranking client-authoritative.
- Do not make public chat available before channel membership and moderation states exist.
- Do not connect AI partner chat to an external API as a hard dependency.
- Do not let casino results directly mutate partner emotion without an event boundary.
- Do not add broad visual redesign before UI surfaces are named in code.
